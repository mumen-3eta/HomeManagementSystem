In PiperNet it is securely stored on multiple devices in the network, which makes it harder to hack and interfere with your data.\",\r\n          show: false,\r\n        },\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  methods: {\r\n    // to show and hid content\r\n    ChangeStatus(numberQuestion) {\r\n      let ListQuestions = this.$data.ListQuestions;\r\n      ListQuestions[numberQuestion].show = !ListQuestions[numberQuestion].show;\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n@import \"../../assets/css/_askedQuestionScStyle.css\";\r\n</style>\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AskedQuestionSc.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
